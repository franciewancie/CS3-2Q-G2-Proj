            <h2>Overall Opinion: Palestine vs Israel</h2>
            <p>The situation in Palestine, particularly the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, has garnered international concern due to relentless violence and allegations of human rights abuses. Many argue that these actions amount to genocide, as Palestinian lives are disproportionately impacted, with entire communities suffering severe consequences.</p>
            <p>In Gaza, repeated military offensives, like the escalation in 2023, have led to devastating outcomes, with countless Palestinian civilians, women and children alike, being onslaught with no remorse. The overwhelming loss of innocent lives, along with reports of indiscriminate attacks, paints a picture of an ongoing tragedy. It’s hard to ignore the patterns of systematic targeting towards innocent housing, schools, hospitals, and vital services, leaving many without shelter, safety, or basic necessities. This widespread destruction—estimated to have damaged and/or destroyed around 70% of buildings—worsens Gaza’s already fragile humanitarian situation, raising serious concerns about the use of collective punishment.</p>
            <p>More than 1.5 million Palestinians have been forced to flee, adding to a refugee crisis that has persisted since Israel’s establishment. For those left behind, Gaza’s blockade fuels rapid poverty, widespread hunger, and severe shortage of medical supplies, pushing people to live in increasingly inhumane conditions. These policies push oppression that aligns disturbingly with practices of ethnic cleansing and cultural erasure.</p>
            <p>The term “genocide” isn’t used lightly, yet we believe it accurately reflects the reality Palestinians face under such systematic oppression. The accusation points to a broader, urgent need for justice and peace in the region, where Palestinian lives are treated with dignity and respect and historical grievances are put aside. The principle of human rights is clear: no group deserves mistreatment, persecution, violence, etc., but instead, the universal right to a safe, dignified life.</p>

The principle of human rights is clear: no group deserves mistreatment, persecution, or violence. Instead, they deserve the universal right to a safe, dignified life.</p>
            <p>To sum it up, our team stands firmly with Palestine, advocating for justice, peace, and the recognition of Palestinian rights and humanity. We believe that only through addressing the deep-rooted injustices and ensuring accountability can a fair and lasting solution be achieved.</p>
